### Point Common at the API Server

To view the application with data you'll need to provide a URL to a running API server. You can use
docker to create a local server following the [Quick Setup Guide](https://github.com/ilios/ilios/blob/master/docs/ilios_quick_setup_for_admins.md) for Ilios or point to an existing API server. 

Pass that information to the application using the `ILIOS_FRONTEND_API_HOST` environmental variable.

```bash
ILIOS_FRONTEND_API_HOST=https://demo.iliosproject.org pnpm start
```
